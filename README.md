SpeakHere (temporary name)
==========================

Based on Apple's SpeakHere sample, this project aims to expand it by adding the ability to send audio data to a remote server for speech recognition via WebSocket. We will be using [kaldi-gstreamer-server](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server).

## Getting started

1. Get [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and set it up properly.
2. In the project root directory, run `pod install` (if this fails, CocoaPods is not set up properly).
3. Remember to open the project in Xcode via the workspace, not the project file!
